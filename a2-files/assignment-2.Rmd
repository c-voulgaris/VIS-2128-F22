# Deliverable

Submit a map with showing the data you described in 
Assignment 1, with each dataset as a separate layer. 

Your map should be attractive and informative (inset maps, north arrows, and 
scale bars are very helpful in making a map informative, but I'm not 
dogmatic about including them if your audience doesn't need them). It should 
clearly indicate the source of each layer in your map. It should
also include a couple of sentences describing the audience for your map and
the argument you are making or the message you are conveying to them with
your map.

On your submission, list the name(s) of at least one student who was 
especially helpful you you in completing this assignment, and describe 
how they helped.
