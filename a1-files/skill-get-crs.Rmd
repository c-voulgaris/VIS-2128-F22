```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

It can often be important to know what coordinate reference system your
data is in.

# Required packages

This example uses the following packages:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tigris)
library(sf)
library(here)
```

# Loading example data

I'll start by loading a set of census tracts using the `tigris`
package.

```{r, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
tracts <- tracts(state = "Illinois",
                 county = "Cook") 
```

# Finding the Coordinate reference system

The `st_crs()` function returns some text that indicates the coordinate
reference system for your data. You can also use this function to 
set the CRS for one layer to match another layer, as described 
[here](https://c-voulgaris.github.io/VIS-2128-F22/a1-files/skill-convert-crs.html){target="_blank"}.

```{r}
st_crs(tracts)
```
