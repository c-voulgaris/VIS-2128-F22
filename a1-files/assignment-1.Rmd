# Deliverable

Submit a description each of three spatial datasets with approximately 
the same spatial extent. One dataset should be a set of points; one should be a 
set of polygons; and one should be a set of lines. Your description can be 
entirely text, and it may include tables and other graphics. You should include 
the following information about each dataset.

* The spatial extent
* The unit of observation
* The spatial data type (e.g. points, lines, or polygons)
* The spatial data format (e.g. KML, geoJSON, shapefile, R simple features)
* A description of each variable
* The coordinate reference system
* The data source (who created the data and where did you find it)

Choose wisely and carefully! You will be working with these three datasets for
the remainder of this course.
