# Deliverable

Generate a map to communicate the distances between features
using buffers and/or by symbolizing features based on 
their distance from other features. Your map layout should 
include a description of the analysis question your
map is meant to address and a clear description of what each 
layer represents (this might be in the map legend). Do not 
include a story about how you made the map (e.g. "I generated 
a set of buffers") or the technology you used. Focus on the 
what the map shows and what conclusions you can draw from it.

Include the sources of all the data shown
in your map (including any data that isn't shown but was 
used to derive the layers you've shown), the name of a
classmate who was helpful to you, and how they helped.
